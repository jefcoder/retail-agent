"""LLM reasoning-quality judge with circuit-breaker protection.

Scores one dialogue per call from a scoring worker thread. A bad token or a
flapping inference provider can otherwise turn into a per-problem retry
storm, so consecutive total-failure outcomes (or exceptions) trip a circuit
breaker that suppresses further calls for the rest of the run.
